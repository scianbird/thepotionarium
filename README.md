# The Potionarium

A "cookie clicker" game (week 03 Assessment)

## Game Objectives and Instructions

Congratulations! You have just opened your very own potion materials store, and you have acess to what every magic-using creature in the world wants to get their hands (or paws, or talons, or tentacles...) on. Collect dragon scales by clicking your pet dragon -- the scales flake right off! Automate your process with spells (when you have enough scales required for the spell to work). Have fun!

## Aims, Planning and Design

I am aiming to meet all of the required goals as well as at least 2 stretch goals and have a working game with some level of personalisation that showcases my design ideas and capabilites, as well as a hint of whimsy. My immediate thoughts when introduced to the concept was what "backstory" or context I could apply to the goal of collecting a resource that you could then spend in order to collect more of that resource. From there a logical step (for my mind, anyway) was gathering something for a poition -- looking at the little dragon filter in Google Meets, the decision was made.

I want the visual design to have a cohesive colour palette, a clear theme to the setting/atmosphere (a magic potion shop) and hand-drawn illustrations for elements such as the dragon that users will click. When it comes to layout design, I am expecting to make quite a few changes between the desktop and app versions (see wireframes below) as well as the ability to show/hide elements on both versions.

For this project I want to add 3 breakpoints: large/desktop (greater than 1024px), medium/tablet (max-width: 1024px) and small/phones (max-width: 768px). I got the values for the breakpoints for googling for the most common breakpoints and taking an example from (https://blog.logrocket.com/css-breakpoints-responsive-design/). Although I have only planned for 2 wireframe layouts, the "medium" version can be understood as a middle point between the two and so there should be clear logic when it comes time for me to style the elements.

## Building

For the first time I used branches as I was building in order to periodically upload to github - I want to get better about this, and braver about using the terminal (right now I do everything from VSCode, including making and naming the new branches)

Most of my thoughts as I was working on the functionality of the game are in the comments of my javascript file (sorry about that...) but overall I am feeling a little more sure-footed in javascript this week and at the very least fairly able to break down something like these idle games into lists of functions etc that will have to be written. Writing them..? Well that still takes a lot of trial and error (and help from classmates, special shoutout to Dylan for kindly talking me through when I hit a wall with my thinking)

There are aspects I'm not able to implement right now, and maybe this is something I will go back to and periodically update as I improve and am exposed to more approaches but for now I'm happy to make the best of what I've got. And that means it's time for ...

## Styling

My beloved.. wireframes I made on figma are upthread, but overall I had a very clear visual look for this. Something I would like to consider in the future is "training myself" into thinking about mobile-first designing, as I always end up scaling something down rather than scaling it up. Which might be easier. Who knows. Emotionally I am still on the family computer loading websites.

I could talk about this all day, but I will try and keep it relevant. Visual assets are hand-drawn on Procreate, airdropped from my iPad and slotted into place after ensuring that the functionality all works as intended/expected. Until that point I'm working with kind of a recreated wireframe like so (and maybe occasionally updating something or stuling a button here and there to keep the fire in my heart alive):
